## Project Description
**Garbage Image Classification** is an AI-powered web application capable of classifying waste into three main categories: **Plastic**, **Glass**, and **Metal**.  

Users can upload a photo of waste through the browser, and the system will automatically classify it based on the trained model.  
The model was trained using **FastAI** and deployed on the web using **TensorFlow.js**, enabling it to run directly in the browser without additional servers.

## Dataset
This project uses a public dataset from Kaggle:  
[Garbage Classification V2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)  

The dataset contains thousands of waste images categorized into three classes:
- Plastic  
- Glass  
- Metal

## Project Benefits
- **Supporting Sustainability & ESG** → helps corporate sustainability programs.  
- **Operational Efficiency** → speeds up waste identification and separation.  
- **Proof-of-Concept AI** → demonstrates browser-based AI implementation.  
- **Public Education** → encourages communities to adopt waste sorting.

## Future Development
- Add more waste categories (organic, paper, residual).  
- Integration with IoT (e.g., smart bins with automated cameras).  
- Real-time analytics dashboard.  
- Industrial-scale deployment for urban waste management.
